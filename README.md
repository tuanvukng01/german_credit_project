# German Credit Risk Analysis and Classification

## Overview
This report provides an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and classification model development conducted on the German Credit dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The aim of the project was to thoroughly analyze dataset features, visualize insights, and construct predictive models capable of classifying applicants into distinct categories of credit risk (Good Risk vs. Bad Risk).

## Dataset Description
The German Credit dataset contains 1,000 loan application records. Each record is characterized by various numeric, categorical, ordinal, and encoded features related to the applicantâ€™s financial status, personal information, loan purpose, and more. The main classification target is the applicantâ€™s credit risk:

- **Good Credit Risk (Class 1)** â€“ approximately 70% of the dataset
- **Bad Credit Risk (Class 2)** â€“ approximately 30% of the dataset

For more details, refer to the dataset source: [UCI German Credit Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data)).

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preparation and Preprocessing

The dataset was initially loaded from a CSV file (`data/raw/german_credit.csv`) containing a mix of numerical and categorical variables, many of which were **custom-coded** using abbreviations or numerical codes. Below is a preview of the raw dataset before any transformation:

To make the data human-readable and ready for analysis, a SQL script was executed to **decode the custom features** using mappings from the original dataset documentation. Additionally, columns were renamed using a JSON-based mapping to improve interpretability.

The resulting **processed dataset** contains **98 columns**:
- **21 original features**
- **77 derived features** from one-hot encoding and engineered variables  
This transformed dataset was saved to:  
`data/processed/credit_features.csv`

---

### ðŸ§¼ Cleaning and Encoding

- **Missing categorical values** were imputed with a default `"Unknown"` label to preserve completeness without data loss.
- The column `Personal Status & Sex` was **binary encoded** to extract a simple `Sex` feature.
- The target label `Risk Label` was mapped to a new column `Target`, where:
  - `1` represents **Good Credit Risk**
  - `0` represents **Bad Credit Risk**  
This encoding made the target suitable for binary classification tasks.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory phase involved detailed statistical analysis and visualization:

### Data Overview
To gain a quick overview of the dataset, we computed descriptive statistics for the numerical features. Since the dataset has already been one-hot encoded, this summary focuses only on continuous variables. A few redundant or uninformative columns were excluded to streamline the analysis.

The table below displays key statistics such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for each numerical feature. To improve readability, the summary is styled with a blue gradient and exported as an image for easy reference.

### Class Balance Analysis
A significant imbalance was observed, with good credit risks constituting 70% of cases. This imbalance can bias predictive models toward the majority class. The imbalance was visualized using both count and pie charts:

### Numerical Distribution by Risk
Descriptive statistics for numerical features such as Credit Amount, Loan Duration, and Age revealed skewed distributions, especially notable in the Credit Amount and Loan Duration features. Density plots helped visualize differences between Good and Bad risk classes, showing that higher loan amounts and longer durations tended to correlate more strongly with bad credit risks.

Boxplots further clarified that Bad Risk loans were typically higher in amount and longer in duration:

### Categorical Feature Analysis
The analysis of categorical features such as Loan Purpose, Housing Type, and Personal Status & Sex highlighted key trends. For instance, people with rented housing or those seeking loans for used cars and retraining exhibited higher proportions of bad credit risk:

![Categorical Analysis - Personal Status & Sex](plots/categorical_distribution_Personal_Status_and_Sex.svg)

### Correlation Analysis
A correlation heatmap showed moderate internal correlations within grouped features (one-hot encoded categories) but relatively weak correlations across different feature groups, indicating minimal multicollinearity.

### Normality Checks (Q-Q Plots)
Quantile-Quantile plots indicated significant deviations from normality in numerical features, particularly evident in the distribution tails of Credit Amount:

## Model Development

### Train-Test Split and Feature Scaling
The dataset was split into training (80%) and test sets (20%) using stratified sampling to preserve class distribution. Feature scaling was performed using both standardization and min-max scaling techniques to ensure effective model training.

### Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce feature dimensionality, capturing 95% of variance in fewer components. PCA effectively visualized class separations in a 2-dimensional space:

### Addressing Class Imbalance
To handle class imbalance, various resampling techniques such as Cluster Centroids (undersampling), SMOTE, and KMeans-SMOTE (oversampling) were employed, as shown in the comparative visualization below:

## Classification Models and Evaluation

Three classification modelsâ€”Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)â€”were trained and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation optimized for the F1 score.

### Model Performance
Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model, exhibiting the highest F1 score, precision, recall, and area under the Precision-Recall curve (PR-AUC). Performance across models is summarized:

Confusion matrices and precision-recall curves further provided detailed insights into model performances:

## Conclusions
Random Forest demonstrated superior predictive capability, leveraging key features such as Checking Account Status, Loan Duration, and Credit History. Addressing class imbalance significantly enhanced model effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of proper data preprocessing.

## Recommendations and Future Work
Future improvements could involve additional feature engineering, advanced hyperparameter tuning, and exploring ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM). Additionally, addressing outliers and applying transformations to skewed data might further improve model performance and stability.
